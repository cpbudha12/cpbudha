        <h1>Famous story behind the buddha</h1>
        <p>In many ways, the story of Buddhism all begins in Lumbini, under a full moon more than 2600 years ago. It was on that night that Queen Mayadevi is said to have stopped here during her travels to give birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha, who would find enlightenment and become Buddha 35 years later.

            Legend says Queen Mayadevi bathed in a pond and lay down under a sal tree in Lumbini Garden before the birth. Immediately after he was born, Prince Siddhartha walked seven steps to the north, looked around, and announced that there would be no more rebirth for him, signalling his destiny. He was then given a purification bath in the same pond his mother had bathed in.
            
            The year was 623 BC and it was just the start of a long journey for Prince Siddhartha to become Buddha, and an even longer journey for the religion that would take his name. So, itâ€™s no surprise that Lumbini has become one of the most revered places for Buddhists around the world.</p>

    <h1>Gautam budhha early life</h1>
    <p>He was born into a life of luxury as a prince. His father was King Suddhodana Tharu and his mother was Queen Maya. He grew up in India, which at the time was dominated by the Brahmanic religions. He had many Hindu beliefs, including the idea of samsara which was deeply embedded in Hindu teachings.
        We are told that knowing well what was in store for his son, his father tried his best to shield him from all possible spiritual contacts and influences by surrounding him with pomp and luxury and providing all material comforts, so that when he grew up he would become a great ruler. He built three palaces for his son with all the comforts and amenities and arranged for his training in in martial arts and education in various subjects necessary for conduct of state affairs. We are told that despite of these arrangements the young Siddhartha was still drawn occasionally into philosophical and contemplative thinking during which he would suffer from deep despair.
        When he reached the age of sixteen he was married to a beautiful princess called Yashodhara. She was the daughter of a Sakya Chieftain called Suprabuddha. He had a son through her by the name Rahula. We do not know much about his family life, except that he cared for his wife and spent considerable time in her company. We do not know whether he had any liaison with some other women too. Yashodhara was probably a very dutiful wife, who might have suffered later in life when the Buddha finally left her.
        During this period he went through four strange experiences which the Buddhists refer as the "Four Noble Signs". They changed his thinking completely and brought a fundamental change in his attitude towards the life he was leading till then.
        The first of these signs was the sight of an old and decrepit man. This made him think about the decay inherent in all life. The second was the sight of a sick and ailing man. This made him think about the suffering inherent in existence.
        These experiences prompted the young Siddhartha to review the life he was leading till then and change it if he could. He was overwhelmed with a sense of grief and compassion for the troubles of the mankind. He decided not to rest till he found suitable answers to the questions that were troubling him for some time. His son Rahula was just born then, as if circumstances were making it a little more difficult for him to leave his wife and worldly life behind.

<h1>Early struggle</h1>
<p1>After Channa's departure, he proceeded on foot to a near by mango grove called Anupia and stayed there for a week, contemplating on the possible course of action he was to take. After a few days he decided to go to Rajagriha, the capital of the famous Magadha Kingdom, ruled then by the equally famous king, Bimbisara, who was a man of noble qualities and great vision. We are told that when he was in Magadha, he was visited by king Bimbisara, who tried to persuade him unsuccessfully not to renounce his princely ways and worldly life. But Siddhartha, could not be persuaded. He remained firm in his resolve. He promised him nothing. But he gave him the assurance that when he attained enlightenment, he would first come to Magadha only to preach his gospel to the people there.

<h1>importance of budhhism</h1>
<p>Buddhists believe that human life is a cycle of suffering and rebirth, but that if one achieves a state of enlightenment (nirvana), it is possible to escape this cycle forever. Siddhartha Gautama was the first person to reach this state of enlightenment and was, and is still today, known as the Buddha. Buddhists do not believe in any kind of deity or god, although there are supernatural figures who can help or hinder people on the path towards enlightenment.
